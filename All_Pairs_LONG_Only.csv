CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES NOTICE OF COLLECTION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS
California and Other State Notice of Information Collected and/or Disclosed
The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq.), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), affords consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. In addition, privacy laws in Virginia provide consumers residing in that those states certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California or Virginia resident, this section applies to you as indicated.

If you are a California applicant or employee, employee applicant, or contractor, please refer to the ETC Privacy Notice for California Applicants/Employees for a description of ETC’s privacy practices in that context, and if you are a California business contact, please see our Notice at Collection for California Business Contacts.

We collect and have collected in the preceding 12 months the following categories of personal information:

Category of Personal Information	Examples of Personal Information Collected
Identifiers.	A real name, alias, postal address, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address.
California Customer Records or similar information under applicable state privacy laws.	A name, address, telephone number, or any other financial information.
Commercial information.	Records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
Internet or other similar network activity.	Browsing history, search history, information on a Consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.
Sensory data.	Audio (such as call recordings).
Professional or employment-related information.	Name of employer, job title.
We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the Use of Information section above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes to the following categories of recipients:

Category of Personal Information	Categories of Recipients
Identifiers.	Vendors of infrastructure and software platform providers, cloud services.
California Customer Records.	Vendors of infrastructure and software platform providers, cloud services.

Professional or employment-related information.	Vendors and service providers, web hosting and internet service providers, information technology, customer service, cloud service, data analytics, marketing, and advertising.
We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you. We retain personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other purposes described in this privacy policy.

Sale of Personal Information
California law requires that we provide transparency about personal information we ”sell.” “Sale” under California law, broadly means scenarios in which we have disclosed personal information with partners in exchange for valuable consideration. In addition, California and other state privacy laws define “sale” to include disclosure of Personal Information with third parties for monetary consideration. In the preceding twelve (12) months, ETC has not sold personal information.

We do not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16.

Information Relevant to California and Other States
The CPRA requires that we notify you if we “Share” your personal information with third parties. For purposes of the CPRA, “Sharing” means that we make available or otherwise disclose your information to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, such as targeting of advertising to you based on your personal information obtained from your activity across businesses, websites, apps, and services other than our Services.

Similarly, Virginia’s privacy law requires that we notify you if we use your information for Targeted Advertising. Targeted Advertising means displaying advertisements to you where the advertisement is selected based on personal information obtained from your activities over time and across nonaffiliated websites or online applications to predict your preferences or interests.

Accordingly, we “Share” and use your information for Targeted Advertising. Specifically, we disclose your identifiers and internet or other network activity with Service Providers and third parties with whom you direct us to disclose your personal information.

To opt out of targeted advertising, sharing, and sales of your personal information, please follow the prompts here. If you are a California resident, you may also opt out of certain “sharing,” “targeted advertising,” and “sales” by visiting our Services with a legally recognized universal choice signal enabled (such as the Global Privacy Control). Please note that, depending on which legally recognized opt-out preference signal you use and whether you are logged into your account with us, our processing of the signal may be limited to the specific browser or device that you are using. You may need to renew your opt-out choice if you use a different browser or device to access our Services.

Privacy Rights
Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose, (2) request correction of your personal information, (3) request deletion of your personal information, (4) opt out of any “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information that may be occurring, and (5) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. You may make these requests by calling 877-512-2306 or sending an email to privacy@etcconnect.com. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your recent interactions with us. If you are not satisfied with our response to your Privacy Rights request, you may appeal that response by submitting this Appeals form (link here).

If we receive your request from an authorized agent and they do not provide a valid power of attorney, we may ask the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request to exercise rights on your behalf. In the absence of a valid power of attorney, we may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or confirm to us that you otherwise provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please call 877-512-2306.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data. Please refer to this Global Privacy Policy for additional disclosures that apply to you.

Data Retention
We store personal data associated with your MyETC or HES forum account for as long as your account remains active. If you close your account, we will delete your account data in accordance with our data retention policy; otherwise, we will delete your account data after six years of inactivity. If you place an order through the ETC Swag Store, we will have to store the personal data relating to such order for at least as long as necessary to fulfill the order and as long as necessary for compliance with statutory tax and accounting requirements in accordance with our Record Retention Policy, even if you do not have a MyETC or HES Forum account or if your MyETC or HES Forum account has meanwhile been deleted. We store other personal data for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.

Please be aware, however, that dealers are separate legal entities from Ford and have their own privacy practices. You should contact your dealer directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. Although we encourage dealers to fully satisfy their legal obligations (including those relating to privacy), Ford is not responsible for dealers’ compliance with law.

United States Only

This Notice applies only to personal information collected about individuals in the United States. If you are located in another country, please review the Ford privacy notice that applies to your country.

CATEGORIES AND SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Products you use, and the choices you make. We collect personal information about you in different ways and from different sources, including through the Products we provide. Details about our privacy practices relating to Ford and Lincoln vehicles appear in the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below.

Information You Provide to Us

You provide information to us in various ways, including when you create or modify an account with us, use our Products, make a purchase from us, ask us for information about our Products, sign up for an event, enter a contest or sweepstakes, contact the Customer Relationship Center, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we collect the following:

Contact Information: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we collect personal or business information such as name, email address, postal address, and phone number. We may also ask you to provide email addresses of others, for example if you use a “tell-a-friend” tool.
Demographics: When you interact with us or our Products, you may also provide additional information such as your age range, nationality, and gender.
Payment Data: If you make a purchase, we collect credit card numbers and other payment or billing information.
Preferences: You may indicate preferences such as your preferred communication method, language, time zone, and dealer. When you use the vehicle shopping tools on our website, you indicate through your browsing and searches the kinds of vehicles, features, and options you may be interested in.
Audio/Visual: In some cases, you can upload a photo for a profile image when creating an account, or you may provide your photo at an event or as part of a contest or sweepstakes.
Identifiers: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, you may provide us with unique identifiers associated with you. For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.
Security: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one username and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.
Content of Communications: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, website chats or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.
Vehicle Service History: We collect vehicle service history from you when you provide it to us on our sites.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.

Where Ford makes chat features available, we utilize vendors, such as LivePerson. Our vendors that support chat features only use chat communications to support and improve the Ford chat experience.

Information From Your Vehicle

Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.

If your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:

Vehicle Data
Driving Data
Vehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may be derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)
Audio/Visual
Media Analytics
Vehicle Analytics

Which categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below for details and data category definitions.

In limited situations, we may collect Vehicle Location, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the “Our Disclosure of Personal Information” section below.

Information From Your Devices

When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:

Device Details and Network Information: Some devices reveal, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the Cookies section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.
Digital Activity: As described more in the Cookies section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.
Device and Mobile Location: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.

You may use app or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain Products or features, those Products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.

Information We Generate About You

We generate information from the data we collect. For example:

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Our websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.

Cookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, help authenticate your Ford account and enable you to sign in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.

Our websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.

Our websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party vendors. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.

For example, our online Products use third-party tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity.

You can find out how Google Analytics uses data here and how to opt out of Google Analytics here. For more information on how Google uses data when you use our websites, click

Interest-Based Advertising

As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as ""interest-based advertising"" or “online behavioral advertising”.

You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our Your Privacy Choices Page and the additional information below.

Industry-wide opt-outs. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:

United States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance

Mobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.

Browser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.

Do Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.

Email web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.

Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out here.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as whether your personal information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information; whether your personal information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which we collected the information; whether the personal information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property; or whether we are otherwise required or permitted to keep your personal information by applicable laws or regulations. Where personal information is used for more than one purpose, we may retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires.

The personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or vendors maintain facilities. The storage location(s) are chosen to operate efficiently and improve performance. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Notice is processed according to the provisions of this Notice and applicable law wherever the data is located.

Location of Processing European Personal Data. We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections.

The information we collect through this technology may include the first date and time you open our email, and whether you click any links included in our email.

The code is temporarily used by our server or a third party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.

Software Development Kits (SDKs).  These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.

We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Chegg websites and our products and Services, and to address functionality issues.

Data You Provide Directly.

In the case of phone numbers collected through our SMS/MMS/text message programs, these are not shared with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your specific consent.  Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.  If you decide that you do not want to receive communications from a third party, or have questions about their privacy practices, you will need to contact that third party directly.

By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent, except where required by law.

Third Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls/Do-Not-Track 
Chegg works with third party business partners, including online advertising companies, ad agencies, and analytics providers to serve Chegg ads online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (like cookies and web tags) on your device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Information and other information about you, some of which may be personal data or personal information under various state laws. Some of these parties may collect personal data over time when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. We may share information, typically information that has been aggregated or de-identified, pseudonymized, Device ID/Information, and location information with third party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other third parties, including for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads on and off the Services.

If you would like to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, there are a variety of tools available to you:

Our Cookie Opt-Out Tools.  To opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (targeted advertising) via cookies, use the tool available in footer of this webpage. Note that you will need to do this on each of our Services for which you would like to exercise this opt-out right.To opt out of other forms of processing of your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, please complete this form. If you are a California resident, please see our NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS regarding additional rights you have, including how to exercise your “Do Not Sell” and “Do Not Share” rights.

Do Not Track.  Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals offered by some web browsers are settings that request that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and set up Do Not Track here.

Global Privacy Controls.  Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. You can find out more about and set up GPC here.

NAI/DAA Opt-Out.  Some of the companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI provides information regarding targeted advertising and the opt-out procedures of NAI members, including opt-out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit the DAA's website, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for DAA-participating companies.

Mobile Device/AppChoices.  Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register at AppChoices for their intent not to receive targeted advertising.

We use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services report on activities and trends.

You can learn about Google's practices, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.Learn about Adobe's practices here.
Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and that you will continue to receive generic ads while online.

internships.com,california,https://thinkful.com/policies/privacy-policy-california/,"NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

This California Privacy Notice sets forth the disclosures and rights for California Consumers regarding their Personal Information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (""CCPA""), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (""CPRA""), and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder. Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings given in the CCPA and CPRA and the associated regulations, unless otherwise defined.

EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS

California Consumers have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you (""Right to Know""); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we collect about you (""Right to Delete""); (3) that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you (“Right to Correct”), (4) to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising) (“Right to Opt-Out of Sharing”), (5) to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Opt-Out of Sale”), and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information to purposes set forth in the statute, including that use which is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services (“Right to Limit The Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information”), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.

In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it. We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.

Verifying Your Requests

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making.

When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond your full name, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request. Pursuant to the CPRA, we will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise your Right to Opt-Out of Sharing, Right to Opt-Out of Sale, or Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.

Agents

If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user’s behalf, please email your request to privacy@chegg.com per the instructions below. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may, but are not required, to submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.

Right to Know

California Consumers have the right to know what information we have collected about you (the categories and the specific pieces of information).

If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please submit your request here.

In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.

Right to Delete

California Consumers have the right to request that we delete information we have collected from you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please submit your request here.

Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.

Right to Correct Inaccurate Information

California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Correct, please submit your request here.

Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information

As disclosed in the chart below, we may collect certain information which is considered Sensitive Personal Information under California law. This includes race and gender identity. Under the CPRA Regulations, a business must provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information only when its use does not fall within the list of exceptions outlined in Sec. 7027(m). Chegg’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information falls within this list of exemptions and we therefore do not offer an opt-out right at this time.

Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising

California Consumers have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information. Chegg does not sell Personal Information for monetary compensation.

California Consumers also have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising), whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration. If you are a California Consumer and would like exercise your Right to Opt-Out of “Sales” or “Sharing” for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising, please submit your request here.

Cookie-Based Opt-Outs for Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising

Chegg engages in online advertising practices (and certain analytics or similar activities), which may be considered a “sale” or “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising under the CCPA and CPRA. To opt out of cookies set by 3rd parties that may be considered ""sales"" or “sharing” under the CCPA and CPRA, please use the footer titled: “DO NOT SELL MY INFO” at the bottom of this webpage.

In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA and CPRA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies. For more information, please visit: https://www.privacyrights.info/.

Data Retention

We will retain all categories of personal information described in this California Privacy Notice for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this California Privacy Notice, considering the time period reasonably necessary to: provide our Services to you; fulfill and honor the choices and rights you have requested; comply with our contractual obligations; enforce our Terms of Use for the Services; and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Except as noted differently within our Services, we retain your personal information while you have an account with us, or while you are using our Services or continuing to visit us.

Notice of Financial Incentive

Under California regulation, certain aspects of our programs, which provide benefits to consumers, may be considered a financial incentive program. We collect personal information from you, such as your contact information (e.g., phone number or email address) to provide the benefits to you, to better serve you, and to fulfill your requests associated with the program.  To opt into the programs, you may need to provide certain information and agree to applicable program terms.  Please see the terms of the program you are joining for additional description of the program and any additional requirements.  Participation in these programs is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time.  To the extent that we provide programs that may be considered a financial incentive because the program is directly or reasonably related to the collection, deletion or retention of consumer personal information, the value is reasonably related to the overall value we receive from the personal information participants provide specific to the program minus the costs and expenses we incur in providing the program.

Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights

California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA and CPRA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA and CPRA rights.

governed by such third-party’s terms and privacy practices 
and policies, and not by this Privacy Policy. Moreover, if the 
Services integrate with a third-party service, the API that 
performs the integration will enable the relevant third party 
to serve you certain content as well as access some of your 
content. For example, if you wish to upload or otherwise 
share your content to an integrated third-party service such 
asInstagram or TikTok, or to make use of certain functionality 
in those services, the API will enable the applicable third party 
to access your content (such as your photo library).

Parties.
Any data except for 
data which is stored 
locally on your 
device, depending 
on the purpose and 
needs. 
For protecting rights and safety of our Services and Apps, we 
may share Personal Data with others if we believe in good 
faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal 
safety of users or individuals, or any members of the general 
public. This will include legal and law enforcement purposes, 
meaning, in response to a verified request relating to terror 
acts, criminal investigations or alleged illegal activity or any 
other activity that may expose us, you, or any other user to 
legal liability, and solely to the extent necessary to comply 
with such purpose. Such disclosure or access may occur if we 
believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do 
so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to 
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or 
suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) 
such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business 
interests, including the security or integrity of our services.
When we share data with service providers and partners, we ensure they only have access to such 
information that is strictly necessary for us to provide the Services. These parties are required to secure 
the data they receive and to use the data for pre-agreed purposes only while ensuring compliance with 
all applicable data protection regulations (such service providers may use other Non-Personal Data for 
their own benefit).
8. USER RIGHTS 
We acknowledge that different people have different privacy concerns and preferences. Our goal is to be 
clear about what information we collect so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. 
We allow you to exercise certain choices, rights, and controls in connection with your information. 
Depending on your relationship with us, your jurisdiction and the data protection laws that apply to you, 
you have the right to control and request certain limitations or rights to be executed.
For detailed information on your rights and how to exercise your rights, please see the Data Subject 
Request Form (“DSR”) form available here and send it to our DPO: dpo@lightricks.com. 
Further, certain rights can be exercised from the App: you may correct, revise and delete information 
using the App settings at any time, any consent provided may be easily withdrawn, and you may opt-out 
from certain features and tracking, therefore we recommend you use the technical solutions we have 
provided you with to exercise your rights.
9. DATA RETENTION
In general, unless a different retention period is described above, we retain the Personal Data we collect 
for as long as it remains necessary for the purposes set forth above, when permissible by law or regulation, 
or until you request to delete your information, where applicable. 
Other circumstances in which we may retain your Personal Data for longer periods of time when 
permissible by law or regulation include: (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, 
regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements; (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us 
in the event of any complaints or challenges; or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation 
relating to your Personal Data.
Please note that except as required by applicable law or our specific agreements with you, we will not be 
obligated to retain your Personal Data for any particular period, and we are free to securely delete it or 
restrict access to it for any reason and at any time, with or without notice to you. If you have any questions 
about our data retention policy, please contact us by e-mail at: dpo@lightricks.com. 
10.SECURITY MEASURES 
We implement appropriate and industry-standard technical, organizational, and security measures to 
reduce the risks of damage to (or loss of) information, or any unauthorized access or use of information. 
However, these measures do not provide absolute information security. Therefore, although efforts are 
made to secure your Personal Data, it is not guaranteed, and you cannot expect that the Services will be 
immune to information security risks or attacks. Also, as the security of information depends in part on 
the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us, the security of your 
Personal Data depends on you as well. Please make sure to take appropriate measures to use secured 
networks, devices and to protect your access credentials.
Please contact us at: dpo@lightricks.com if you feel that your privacy was not dealt with properly, in a 
way that was in breach of our Privacy Policy, or if you become aware of a third party's attempt to gain 
unauthorized access to any of your Personal Data. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you and the 
appropriate authorities (if required by applicable law) in the event that we discover a security incident 
related to your Personal Data. 
11.INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER 
Our data servers in which we host and store the information are located globally including in the US and 
EU. The headquarters are based in Israel where we may access the information stored on local servers, 
cloud-hosting servers or other systems and platforms used. In the event that we need to transfer your 
Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that your Personal 
Data receives an adequate level of protection as required under applicable law. Furthermore, when 
Personal Data that is collected within the European Economic Area (""EEA""), United Kingdoms or Swiss, is 
transferred outside of such jurisdiction, to a country that has not received an adequacy decision from the 
European Commission or the ICO, we will take necessary steps in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards 
are provided during the transferring of such Personal Data, in accordance with the provision of the EU, UK 
or Swiss Standard Contractual Clauses. Thus, we will obtain contractual commitments or assurances from 
the data importer to protect your Personal Data, using contractual protections that regulators have preapproved to ensure your data is protected. 
12.ELIGIBILITY AND CHILDREN PRIVACY
The Services are not intended for use by children (the phrase ""child"" shall mean an individual that is under 
the age defined by applicable law), and we do not knowingly process children's information. We will 
discard any information we receive from a User that is considered a ""child"" immediately upon discovering 
that such a User shared information with us. Please contact us at: dpo@lightricks.com if you have reason 
to believe that a child has shared any information with us.

CATEGORIES AND SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Products you use, and the choices you make. We collect personal information about you in different ways and from different sources, including through the Products we provide. Details about our privacy practices relating to Ford and Lincoln vehicles appear in the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below.

Information You Provide to Us

You provide information to us in various ways, including when you create or modify an account with us, use our Products, make a purchase from us, ask us for information about our Products, sign up for an event, enter a contest or sweepstakes, contact the Customer Relationship Center, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we collect the following:

Contact Information: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we collect personal or business information such as name, email address, postal address, and phone number. We may also ask you to provide email addresses of others, for example if you use a “tell-a-friend” tool.
Demographics: When you interact with us or our Products, you may also provide additional information such as your age range, nationality, and gender.
Payment Data: If you make a purchase, we collect credit card numbers and other payment or billing information.
Preferences: You may indicate preferences such as your preferred communication method, language, time zone, and dealer. When you use the vehicle shopping tools on our website, you indicate through your browsing and searches the kinds of vehicles, features, and options you may be interested in.
Audio/Visual: In some cases, you can upload a photo for a profile image when creating an account, or you may provide your photo at an event or as part of a contest or sweepstakes.
Identifiers: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, you may provide us with unique identifiers associated with you. For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.
Security: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one username and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.
Content of Communications: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, website chats or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.
Vehicle Service History: We collect vehicle service history from you when you provide it to us on our sites.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.

Where Ford makes chat features available, we utilize vendors, such as LivePerson. Our vendors that support chat features only use chat communications to support and improve the Ford chat experience.

Information From Your Vehicle

Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.

If your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:

Vehicle Data
Driving Data
Vehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may be derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)
Audio/Visual
Media Analytics
Vehicle Analytics

Which categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below for details and data category definitions.

In limited situations, we may collect Vehicle Location, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the “Our Disclosure of Personal Information” section below.

Information From Your Devices

When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:

Device Details and Network Information: Some devices reveal, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the Cookies section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.
Digital Activity: As described more in the Cookies section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.
Device and Mobile Location: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.

You may use app or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain Products or features, those Products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.

Information We Generate About You

We generate information from the data we collect. For example:

Digital Activity: When you build or search for vehicles on our website, we generate results that fit your criteria and allow you to save results so that they are available to you in future visits. When you browse our website or use our other online Products, we may infer your zip code, city, state, and/or country location based on your IP address.
Inferred Preferences: We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics. For example, we may use information about your vehicle and past purchases to determine your likely readiness to make a new purchase, which we may use for marketing, advertising, or other purposes. We may also infer information from your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as webpages visited, vehicles viewed, app features used, etc.
Identifiers: When you interact with us, we may generate unique identifiers associated with you or your devices such as Ford account ID, customer ID, rewards program number, or browser or other online identifiers. These unique identifiers help us identify you or associate you with information about you. For example, in our exhibits at auto shows or other events, we may generate a bar code for each visitor that you can swipe as you interact with the exhibit. It may also allow you to access and spread photos and videos if you use available technology to take your picture and/or video at the event.
Payment Data: We may generate information when you pay for products and services, e.g., transac
Information From Other Sources

We obtain information from others when you direct them to disclose information to us and also from the following sources:

Affiliates: We receive information from other companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. Information is disclosed within this “family” as a normal part of business operations, offering products and services to our customers, and allowing our customers to use their Ford account across multiple Ford experiences (if supported).
Dealers and Other Repairers: We receive information in connection with vehicle sales and service. For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Ford or Lincoln dealer, the dealer provides Contact Information to Ford, including your name and address, as well as VIN and purchase information such as purchase date. We also receive Vehicle Service History information (and certain other vehicle repair information), which includes history of repairs and may include information such as visit details, service details, repair history, applicable recall repairs, repair order details and payment, and warranty and extended service plan information. We may receive vehicle diagnostic information from dealers or other repairers when your vehicle is serviced or repaired using diagnostic scan tools connected to your vehicle.
Vendors and Suppliers: We may receive Contact Information or other personal information from our vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice.
Business Partners: We receive personal information from other companies we work with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:
                    - Advertising and Analytics Companies: Please see the Cookies section of this Notice for a description of how we receive information from advertising and analytics providers.

                    - Joint Marketing Partners: We may receive personal information from partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.

Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulatory agencies, and others: We may receive personal information from government agencies or courts for legal compliance purposes, to protect your personal safety or the safety of others, to protect Ford’s or others’ rights or property, or to investigate fraud. We may also receive personal information from others; for example, in connection with litigation settlements, we may acquire information about you from third parties for the purpose of meeting our tax reporting obligations.
Consumer Data Analytics Firms: We receive Demographics and other data from third parties for purposes such as supporting our marketing campaigns and personalizing Products to our customers.
Parties to Corporate Transactions: We may receive personal information as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of business or assets.
Publicly Available Sources: We may obtain Demographics and other data from publicly available sources, such as open government databases or other data in the public domain, as well as information that is publicly available online on social media, networking, and other sites.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Our websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.

Cookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, help authenticate your Ford account and enable you to sign in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.

Our websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.

Our websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party vendors. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.

For example, our online Products use third-party tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity.

You can find out how Google Analytics uses data here and how to opt out of Google Analytics here. For more information on how Google uses data when you use our websites, click
You can also find more information on Mouseflow’s privacy practices here and how to opt out here.

For more information about the privacy practices of the other listed companies, please review their privacy policies.

You can learn more about how to opt-out of certain cookies and other technologies by visiting our Your Privacy Choices Page.

Interest-Based Advertising

As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as ""interest-based advertising"" or “online behavioral advertising”.

You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our Your Privacy Choices Page and the additional information below.

Industry-wide opt-outs. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:

United States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance

Mobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising 
Browser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.

Do Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.

Email web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.

Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out here.

In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different sources to give you a more seamless, consistent, personalized, and relevant experience. For example, we use your Ford account identifier (if you were logged in while browsing our website or using our other online Products) or a browser or other unique online identifier (if you were not logged into your account) to link Digital Activity to you over time and across different Products or other digital properties, including those owned or operated by third parties.

Finally, we may de-identify information we collect about you (including Connected Vehicle Information) and use it for any purpose in accordance with applicable law.

OUR DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We disclose personal information with your consent, when you direct us to disclose it to others, as necessary to complete your transactions, or provide the Products you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will disclose that data to banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, or other related financial services. We also disclose personal information to:

Affiliates. We disclose personal information among the companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership.

                    - For example, if you are financing your purchase or lease with Ford Credit and Ford Credit asks us to locate your vehicle due to default of your agreement with Ford Credit, we may disclose Vehicle Location with Ford Credit.

                    - If you create a Ford account, we disclose your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one username and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).

Dealers. We disclose personal information to authorized Ford dealers, for example, to honor your request for a price quote on a vehicle, to assist in diagnosing service needs, to understand when your vehicle is ready for scheduled maintenance, to allow you to redeem rewards points from Ford loyalty programs at the dealership, to support our joint marketing activities, or to provide a dealer with information for purposes of contacting you in their regular course of business.
Vendors, Suppliers, and Agents. We disclose personal information to vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice. In such cases we require them to use it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they receive. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information to provide those functions.
Business Partners. We disclose personal information to other companies that we work together with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:

Those users are identifiable to the Social Media company when it matches our hashed data to its hashed data of its users.

                    - Joint Marketing Partners. We disclose information to partners with which we offer co-branded service or engage in joint marketing activities.

                    - Vehicle Verification and Valuation Partners.

The features and options information that we disclose to these third parties is linked to the unique vehicle identification number (VIN).

Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others. We will disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is necessary to:

                    - In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;

As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as ""interest-based advertising"" or “online behavioral advertising”.

You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our Your Privacy Choices Page and the additional information below.

Industry-wide opt-outs. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:

United States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance

Mobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising 
Browser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.

Do Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.

Email web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.

Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out here.

OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We use the personal information we collect for purposes described in this Notice or otherwise disclosed to you. For example, we have used personal information for the following purposes, including:

Product and Service Delivery: To provide and deliver our products and services, including operating, securing, and troubleshooting; providing support for vehicle service, warranty, and recall; providing customer service and technical support; and providing credit and financing services.
Product Improvement: To improve existing products and services.
Research and Development: To conduct research and develop new products and services.
Personalization: To understand you and your preferences, to make recommendations, and to deliver personalized experiences, customer relationship management, and Products centered around you. This may include the use of automated processing in support of these activities.
Dealer Support: To support dealer operations.
Marketing and Advertising: To promote our products and services and those of our selected partners through marketing, advertising, and sponsorships (see the Cookies section below for information about personalized advertising and your advertising choices and the Choice and Control of Personal Information section for how to change your preferences for promotional communications).
Business Operations: To operate our business and perform business functions, such as accounting, finance, tax, regulatory compliance, litigation, information security, fraud detection and prevention, protection of our rights and property, supplier and vendor management, human resources, information technology, and improving our internal operations.
Support for Laws, Property, Safety, and Exigent Circumstances: To support our compliance with valid inquiries and directives from law enforcement or other government agencies; in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public; and to protect the rights or property of others. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different sources to give you a more seamless, consistent, personalized, and relevant experience. For example, we use your Ford account identifier (if you were logged in while browsing our website or using our other online Products) or a browser or other unique online identifier (if you were not logged into your account) to link Digital Activity to you over time and across different Products or other digital properties, including those owned or operated by third parties.

Finally, we may de-identify information we collect about you (including Connected Vehicle Information) and use it for any purpose in accordance with applicable law.

OUR DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We disclose personal information with your consent, when you direct us to disclose it to others, as necessary to complete your transactions, or provide the Products you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will disclose that data to banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, or other related financial services. We also disclose personal information to:

Affiliates. We disclose personal information among the companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. We disclose information within this “family” as a normal part of business operations and offering products and services to our customers:
                    - For example, if you are financing your purchase or lease with Ford Credit and Ford Credit asks us to locate your vehicle due to default of your agreement with Ford Credit, we may disclose Vehicle Location with Ford Credit.

                    - If you create a Ford account, we disclose your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one username and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).

Dealers. We disclose personal information to authorized Ford dealers, for example, to honor your request for a price quote on a vehicle, to assist in diagnosing service needs, to understand when your vehicle is ready for scheduled maintenance, to allow you to redeem rewards points from Ford loyalty programs at the dealership, to support our joint marketing activities, or to provide a dealer with information for purposes of contacting you in their regular course of business.
Vendors, Suppliers, and Agents. We disclose personal information to vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice. In such cases we require them to use it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they receive. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information to provide those functions.
Business Partners. We disclose personal information to other companies that we work together with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:
                    - SIRIUS XM. We disclose Contact Information to SiriusXM so that SiriusXM can provide satellite radio offers to vehicle purchasers, including offers for paid subscriptions.

                    - Advertising and Digital Analytics Companies. Please see the Cookies section of this Notice for a description of how we work with advertising and digital analytics providers.

                    - Social Media Platforms. We disclose hashed emails from our marketing database or other information we have collected as described in this Notice to social media advertising platforms, such as Facebook, so that they can create Custom Audiences and deliver advertisements on our behalf to their users. Those users are identifiable to the Social Media company when it matches our hashed data to its hashed data of its users.

                    - Joint Marketing Partners. We disclose information to partners with which we offer co-branded service or engage in joint marketing activities.

                    - Vehicle Verification and Valuation Partners. We disclose information about factory-installed vehicle features and options to third parties such as auction companies, insurance companies, dealers, lenders, guidebook providers, vehicle websites, and prospective buyers so that they can verify a vehicle’s features and options and estimate its value. The features and options information that we disclose to these third parties is linked to the unique vehicle identification number (VIN).

Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others. We will disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is necessary to:
                    - Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;

                    - In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;

                    - Detect, investigate, prevent or otherwise address fraud or privacy issues;

                    - Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or remediate an attack on our computer systems or networks; or

                    - Protect the rights or property of ourselves, our affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.

Parties to Corporate Transactions. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets.

Finally, we may disclose de-identified information (including Connected Vehicle Information) to others in accordance with applicable law.

OTHER SITES AND SERVICES

Our websites, mobile applications, and other Products may contain links to other content, products, services, features, websites, mobile applications, platforms, or properties that Ford doesn’t own or operate (“Other Sites”) even if they look similar to ours. Please be aware that Ford is not responsible for any Other Sites, their content or operation, or the privacy policies or data practices of the third parties that offer them, even if you access them via our Products, including:

Dealer websites;
Websites or services featuring events, promotions, sponsorships, contests, or sweepstakes offered by our business partners (even where co-branded with Ford or Lincoln or our Products);
Websites or services offered by companies that have received a license to use our name, logo, or other trademarks in connection with their service or product offerings (including those that offer accessories or other products available for use with Ford or Lincoln vehicles);
Advertisers on our websites;
Social media or networking platforms; and
Product review, news, or enthusiast/fan sites and other forums, message boards, or chat groups where our Products are discussed.

For example, some of our website features incorporate the Google reCAPTCHA tool, which collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, in order to perform integrity checks and help prevent bots from using the feature. Your use of the reCAPTCHA tool is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

Ford is also not responsible for third party applications or services that are governed by a privacy policy other than Ford’s and that may:

Be integrated with or offered through our Products;
Be made available to you through the vehicle infotainment system or in our mobile apps;
Be made available to you through the third party's app on your mobile device when you connect your mobile device to the vehicle via Bluetooth or tether; or
Require or permit the account you have with the third party to be linked to a Ford or Lincoln vehicle, mobile application, or other Product.

For example, some of our websites and online Products include mapping features provided by Google, HERE, and Microsoft (Bing Maps), which will collect and use personal information, including location information. If you use those mapping services, provide personal information to any of those third parties, or consent to our disclosure of personal information to them, the personal information they receive is governed by their privacy statements available via the above links. For example, if you use Bing Maps you agree to be bound by the Bing Terms of Use and Microsoft Privacy Policy.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as whether your personal information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information; whether your personal information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which we collected the information; whether the personal information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property; or whether we are otherwise required or permitted to keep your personal information by applicable laws or regulations. Where personal information is used for more than one purpose, we may retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires.

LOCATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or vendors maintain facilities. The storage location(s) are chosen to operate efficiently and improve performance. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Notice is processed according to the provisions of this Notice and applicable law wherever the data is located.

Location of Processing European Personal Data. We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Safeguarding personal information is important to us. While no systems, applications, or websites are 100% secure, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

To help us protect personal information, we request that you use a strong password and never disclose your password to anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

a) Facebook Social Plugins

We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site facebook.com, a service of Meta Platforms Inc, 1 Hacker Way Menlo Park, California 94025, USA (“Meta”). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” on blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.

If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser.

Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.

The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.

If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage.

The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the “Facebook Blocker“.

b) Twitter

We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share an article or a website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.

If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly connects to Twitter’s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. According to the provider’s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website’s URL when the button is loaded from Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the Twitter-button.

Further information can be found in Twitter’s privacy statement under: https://twitter.com/privacy.

Please understand that we cannot delete personal information in those situations where our retention is required for Business Purposes as detailed above. In these situations, we will retain your information in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.

We do not offer financial incentives for the collection, sale, or sharing of personal information, although we may offer individuals the opportunity to receive coupons or discounts via email. If you ask us to delete your information, we will not be able to send you additional coupons or discounts via email, however coupons or discounts sent to you previously will continue to be honored according to their original terms.  We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under CPRA.

To the extent advertising technology activities (e.g online advertising, e-commerce and related tools) are interpreted  as a “sale” or “share” under the CPRA , please visit the cookie preference center when you first visit a Springer Nature site to opt out of such sales. You have the ability to update your preferences at any time via the ""Your Privacy Choices / Manage Cookies"" link in the page footer of the same site. We collect pseudonymised or aggregated data, e.g. shortened IP addresses to analyse the use of our websites and, thereby, improve and optimize the websites and to display advertising tailored to your needs. We collect this data (to improve your website experience and to promote our products and services) via an internal cookie management tool.

To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send an email from your own email address to customerservice@springernature.com indicating the name and email address of your agent. We will respond to requests using both your email address and the agent’s email address. The request must provide enough information for us to reasonably verify you are, or are the authorized representative of, the person about whom we collected personal information. For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the Contacting Us section of the Privacy Policy  of the website you are visiting.

Verifying Requests. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.  If you have an account with us, we may verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account.  If you do not have an account with us and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we may require you to provide additional information reasonable enough to verify your identity.  In addition, if you do not have an account and you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.

Additional Information. If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CPRA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your verifiable consumer request, if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Response Timing and Format: 

We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us again. We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

Non-Personal, De-Identified, or Product-Level Information
We may create non-personal, de-identified, or product level records (“De-Identified Data”) from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data identifiable to you. Once we create De-Identified Data, this De-Identified Data is our property. We use this De-Identified Data in many ways including analyzing request and usage patterns, creating reports and performing analytics so that we may enhance the content of our products and services (or those of a third party), improve navigation, and provide meaningful analysis of habits, usage, trends, and effectiveness of marketing campaigns etc. as part of our analytics and other services. We reserve the right to use, disclose, share, and sell De-Identified Data to third parties in our absolute discretion.

You can access, update, and correct or delete inaccuracies by logging into your account for the particular TiVo product or service. For example, to update or manage your information related to a TiVo DVR product or the TiVo online service you may visit tivo.com.

CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT, REFERRED TO AS FUNCTIONAL DATA, ARE NECESSARY FOR YOUR TIVO PRODUCT TO PERFORM ITS BASIC FUNCTIONS SECURELY AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF THE COLLECTION OF THIS FUNCTIONAL DATA AND ITS USE TO PROVIDE PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY.

If you have questions about your privacy on TiVo products or services, this privacy policy, or information we have about you, please contact us at privacyrequest@xperi.com.

Opting Out of Personalization and Certain Disclosures and Uses
TiVo allows you to manage many settings within your My Account section of the TiVo website. Log into your account and go to Privacy Status to change your preferences.

TiVo Products such as TiVo DVRs and Minis
You may opt out of having your viewing logs used in TiVo’s analytics business or sharing that de-identified information collected after such opt-out with third parties by logging into My Account and changing your settings under Privacy Status.

You can also cancel your TiVo account which will stop all data collection on the device. Cancelling the TiVo service will stop your TiVo product from functioning.

Cookies and Similar Technologies
When you visit TiVo websites, we and our advertising partners may store and access information from your device, using cookies, web beacons, pixels, add tags or other clear GIFs and similar technologies, and browser details. We may collect information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services used and how you have used them. We and our advertising partners do this for a variety of purposes. In the case of our advertising partners, this may include the personalization of advertisements based on your visits to sites in that party’s network.

Please note there is currently no accepted standard to respond to Do Not Track signals and that at least some of the TiVo websites do not currently respond to a web browser’s Do Not Track instructions (i.e., “signal”). More information about Do Not Track can be found here. Additionally, we may use Google analytics. Google analytics manages ‘Do Not Track’ instructions from your browser in accordance with its own privacy policies, at http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

Another example of how we use cookies might be to track the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns and to show you TiVo ads on other websites after you have visited our website.

Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Site may not function as intended.

We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.

urbanairship.com,california,https://urbanairship.com/legal/california-privacy-rights-notice/,"California Privacy Rights Notice
Last Updated: July 1, 2023 — Previous Version

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which amended the CCPA, are privacy regulations that apply to residents of the State of California, (together, “CCPA”). This notice describes the rights of California residents under the CCPA. We fully describe our practices to all individuals who visit or use the Services in our Privacy Statement. This separate California Privacy Rights Notice sets out our practices as required under CCPA and is limited to Airship’s data practices in California. If you are a California resident job applicant, candidate, current or former employee with Airship, then Airship’s California Employee Privacy Notice applies to you and describes how we collect and use Personal Information about you during and after candidacy, job application, and your employment with us.

What Are the Categories of Personal Information that Airship collects?

Our Privacy Statement describes the information we collect and its sources. The CCPA provides California residents with the right to know what categories of Personal Information Airship has collected about them and whether Airship disclosed that Personal Information for a business purpose (e.g., to a service provider) in the preceding 12 months. This notice organizes that description around the Personal Information categories set forth in the CCPA. California residents can find this information below.

2. What Are Your Rights Under CCPA?

The CCPA gives California residents the following rights:

2.1 Right to Know and Access Personal Information

You (or your authorized representative) can request a copy of your Personal Information. Under CCPA, you can also request that we disclose how we have collected, used, and disclosed your Personal Information over the past 12 months, including the categories of Personal Information we collected and our purposes for doing so; the categories of sources for that information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared it or disclosed it for a business purpose and our purposes for doing so. Companies that sell Personal Information (we do not) must make additional disclosures.

You can submit your request to privacy@airship.com.

2.2 Your Right to Opt Out of Sales

California residents are able to direct a business that sells Personal Information to stop selling that information. Children under the age of 16 must provide opt in consent, with a parent or guardian required to consent for children under 13. Please note that Airship’s Services are not marketed to or intended for minors under the age of 18. We do not sell Personal Information for monetary consideration. In addition, we do not “sell” Personal Information of individuals we know to be under the age of 16.

2.3 Your Right to Opt Out of Sharing

Under the CCPA, you can opt out of the sharing of your Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Like many companies, Airship uses services that employ cookies and other technologies to collect Personal Information (including the identifiers and internet activity information described in the table above) about your use of our Services, which helps us to deliver targeted ads. Our use of some of these services may constitute the “sharing” of Personal Information as defined under the CCPA to/with third party advertisers. You can direct us not to share your Personal Information as described in Section 4 here below (What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We “Share”). The following categories of Personal Data have been shared in the preceding 12 months with third party advertising partners and advertising technology providers so that we can reach you with advertisements for our products and services and make them more relevant to you: identifiers and contact information; and analytics or other electronic network activity. In addition, we do not share Personal Information of individuals we know to be under the age of 16 for cross-context-behavioral advertising.

2.4 Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information

Under the CCPA, you can limit a business’s use and disclosure of your sensitive Personal Information to certain purposes specified by law (e.g., providing you with services you request or preventing fraud, or for other purposes that don’t involve deriving your attributes). We only use sensitive Personal Information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out.

2.5 Your Right to Notification

Under the CCPA, a business like Airship cannot collect new categories of Personal Information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you.

2.6 Right of No Retaliation for Exercising Your CCPA Rights

The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights.

2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information

You can request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information by emailing privacy@airship.com or updating our information in the Airship Platform to the extent such request related to Personal Information tied to your Airship Platform account information.

If you are an Airship customer seeking to correct Personal Information regarding your End User, then Airship makes certain functionalities available in the Airship Platform for correction. More information is available here in the Airship Documentation or by requesting help from support@airship.com.

2.8 Your Right to Delete Personal Information

You can request that we delete your Personal Information by emailing privacy@airship.com. We honor such requests unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or contract for which it was collected or when information is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement.

If you are an Airship customer seeking to correct Personal Information regarding your End User, then Airship makes certain functionalities available in the Airship Platform for correction. More information is available here in the Airship Documentation or by requesting help from support@airship.com.

3. What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We Disclose for a “Business Purpose”?

The CCPA requires us to describe the “business purposes” for which we may disclose your Personal Information. As described in our Privacy Statement in Sections 3 (How does Airship use Personal Information and what are the legal bases for these uses?) and 4 (With whom does Airship share Personal Information?), we collect, retain, use and disclose your Personal Information to support our own operational purposes in providing our Services to you and for one or more of the following business purposes:

Providing information and services you requested
Processing interactions and transactions
Managing interactions and Ttransactions
Marketing products and services
Recruitment and employment as described in Airship’s California Employee Privacy Notice
Performing services
Quality & safety assurance, verification, maintenance, improvement, or enhancement
Security & integrity, including (without limitation) protecting against security incidents and fraudulent, malicious, illegal, or wrongful conduct
Debugging
Short-term, transient use, including non-personalized advertising
Enabling our service providers and business partners (and their service providers and/or subcontractors) to provide services to us
Complying with legal obligations
4. What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We “Share”?

As is common among businesses that operate internet websites, we may disclose the following categories of Personal Information in a way that could be deemed a “sharing” of data for cross-context behavioral advertising under California law: certain identifiers, internet & other electronic network activity information, and inferences. “Sharing” is broadly defined as disclosing personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is defined to include instances where companies target advertising based on personal information obtained from a consumer’s activity across distinctly-branded websites or services. We do not share sensitive Personal Information.

You may opt out of “sharing” by visiting our Cookie Consent Manager or by enabling Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your web browser or browser extension, which we recognize to the extent required by applicable law, adjust your preferences in the cookies consent manager banner as described in the Privacy Statement Section 11 (Your privacy rights. Opt-out of cookies and ads.), or by emailing us at privacy@airship.com. Enabling GPC will automatically set your cookie settings to opt out of the sharing of Personal Information for behavioral advertising. If you choose to use GPC, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. Other than GPC, Airship does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device. For information about “do-not-track”, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org.

5. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?

We keep your Personal Information for the length of time needed to carry out the purposes outlined in this California Privacy Rights Notice and our Privacy Statement and to adhere to our policies on keeping records (unless a longer period is needed by law). Our records policies reflect applicable laws. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to manage your relationship with us to provide you with the Services or to the extent applicable, for employment or recruitment purposes, personalize and improve your overall customer experience, and to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this California Privacy Rights Notice and our Privacy Statementhttps://www.airship.com/legal/privacy/.

6. Who Can Make Requests Regarding Your Personal Information?

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as set forth below.

The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act gives residents certain rights as it relates to personal information. These rights include the right to access and delete certain information we collect about you; to request that we correct information that you believe is inaccurate; to opt out of having personal information about you sold, used for targeted advertising to you, or used to build a profile about you to make legally or similar significant decisions about you; and to appeal the denial of a request to exercise one of these privacy rights.

Personal information we collect and how we use it.

This privacy policy details our collection and use practices. We collect personal information when you interact with us and use our products and services, such as when you place an order or have questions about your account or service; contact us on social media; seek technical support; enter a Visible-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes, or promotion; or register to receive news or updates. We also collect information from certain third-party sources and from the devices you use.  Depending on what products and services you use and how you interact with us, we may collect these categories of personal information:

Contact and device information (including name, billing and email address, mobile device identifiers, IP address and account credentials); information about the products and services you purchase; information about your browsing, search and other activity on our sites and app as well as your interactions with our sites, app and advertisements.

Demographic and interest information that you provide or that we obtain from third parties.

Geolocation information from our app when you permit it; information about how you use our products and services; and chat transcripts when you engage with us.

Secure Account Information including account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account 

And other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you. 

Some of the information that we collect is considered sensitive personal information under Virginia law. The law defines sensitive personal information as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizenship or immigration status; processing genetic or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying you; personal data collected from a known child; and precise geolocation data.

We use this information for business and commercial purposes which include: providing you products and services, operating our businesses, and engaging in economic activities such as communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance. 

Service providers we use to do work on our behalf may use information for the same purposes. We share information with service providers (also known as processors) as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect the information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes we allow. We may also disclose information for legal compliance, fraud detection, with your consent and as further described in other sections of this policy.

You have the right to access and correct information.

You can access specific pieces and categories of personal information we collected by accessing our Data and Privacy Portal or via the email address provided below. To the extent technically feasible, we will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. You can use this same contact information to request that we correct personal information we have about you that you believe may be inaccurate.  

You have the right to delete information. 

You have the right to request that Visible delete personal information we have about you unless we need it for specific reasons. These reasons include complying with laws, rules, regulations, investigative subpoena or summons by governmental authorities; defending against legal claims; providing and maintaining the products and services you use and preventing security incidents. All the personal information we retain today  is only used for these purposes. We retain information only as long as necessary for these purposes and then securely delete it.

You have the right to tell us not to sell personal information or use it for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effect.

Virginia law defines “sale” to mean the exchange of personal data for monetary consideration. We do not sell information as it is defined under Virginia law. We also do not use personal information to profile you to further decisions that have legal or similar significant effects.

You have the right to opt-out of targeted advertising.

Virginia law describes “targeted advertising” as using information from your activities over time and across non-affiliated websites or apps to predict your preferences or interests and target our advertising to you. 

Our activities that fall under the definition of “targeted advertising” under the Virginia law are:

using third-party advertising companies’ cookies, pixels, tags, and other web technologies on our site to collect  information about your activity on our site during your visit  which can be used and combined with other information about you from your activity and behavior across unaffiliated websites and apps to tailor the ads you see from us and others;

sharing consumer information with third-party advertising and social media companies to help them better target our advertising on their websites and applications and to help find other potential customers using interest segments and audiences they create from your activities across non-affiliated websites and apps; and

using consumer information we obtain from third-parties to better customize our advertising, when that information is derived from your activities across non-affiliated sites and apps.

Your can opt out of targeted advertising by accessing Your Privacy Choices .

Use of sensitive personal information.

Virginia law prohibits us from using sensitive personal information without your consent, except for specific purposes specified in the law, including: complying with laws, rules, regulations, investigative subpoena or summons by governmental authorities; defending against legal claims; providing and maintaining the products and services you use; preventing and responding to security and other significant incidents; and taking immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of you or another natural person. The law also allows for short-term transient purposes such as displaying relevant information to you based on your activity during a single interaction. 

We do not use sensitive personal information without your express consent or as authorized under the law. 

You have the right to appeal.

You can appeal a denial of your request to exercise any of the privacy rights provided by Virginia law. If we deny your request, we will notify you. You may submit an appeal using a link in the notice we provide.  You also may submit an appeal by emailing us at privacy@visible.com .

VII. STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

California Consumer Privacy Act 

The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, provides California residents with specific rights.

The law provides you with the right to know what information we collect about you and how we use it; to access and delete that information within certain limits; to request that we correct information that you believe is inaccurate; to tell us not to sell or share personal information about you; to limit the use of certain sensitive personal information; and to not be discriminated against for invoking these rights.

Your Right to Know 

You have the right to know what personal information we collect, how we use it, and how long we keep it. This policy provides details about our collection and use practices. We collect personal information when you interact with us and use our products and services, such as when you place an order, have questions about your service, communicate with us by chat or phone, seek technical support, contact us on social media, visit our website, or enter a Visible-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstake or promotion. We also collect information from certain third-party sources and from our network and the devices you use. 

Depending on what products and services you use and how you interact with us, we may collect these categories of personal information:

Identifiers, including, name, billing and email address, mobile device identifiers, IP address, account credentials, and other similar identifiers

Legally protected classifications, including race, ancestry, gender, and disability if you provide them to us

Commercial information, including products or services you purchase and consider

Internet information, including browsing history, search and other activity on our site, and information regarding your interaction with our websites applications, and advertisements

Geolocation data from our apps when you permit it

Inferences drawn from any of the information described above to create a profile reflecting your preferences, characteristics, predispositions, and behavior.  

Secure Account Information including account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account 

And other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you.

Some of the information we collect may be considered sensitive personal information under this California law which defines sensitive information to include account log-in information with required security or access codes; financial account, debit or credit card number along with required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation when you allow it in our app; and the contents of your mail, email, and text messages unless we are the recipient of the communication.

We use this information for business and commercial purposes as they are defined by the CCPA. Business and commercial purposes include providing you products and services, operating our business and engaging in economic activities such as communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes. 

We share information with service providers as necessary for them to perform work for us. We share with them the information they need to perform that work. This includes personal information about you. For example, we share contact information with service providers who help us send Visible marketing campaigns. Service providers are required to protect the information we share with them or they collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow. 

We may also disclose information with your consent and as further described in other sections of this policy.

Our policies require that we retain records for as long they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records; it is not always retained by distinct data elements. For example, your name could be part of your customer account record, transaction record, or call records. Each type of record may be retained for a different time period depending on its purpose. We have established criteria for how long to keep different types of records.

Your Right to Access or Correct Information

You have the right to request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collect by using our Data and Privacy Portal or via the email address provided below.  We will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. We will honor up to two consumer rights requests every twelve months as required by California law. You can use this same contact information to request that we correct inaccurate personal information we have about you.

Your Right to Delete 

You have the right to request that Visible delete personal information we have about you unless we need it for specific reasons. These reasons include: needing the information to provide the services you have requested and other activities needed to maintain ongoing business relationship with you, to maintain information security, to exercise legal rights and to comply with other laws. All the personal information we retain today is only used for these purposes. We retain the information that we collect only as long as needed for these purposes.

Your Right to Opt Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information 

California law defines “sale or sharing” broadly to include sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the sharing of personal information for cross contextual advertising purposes. The definition does not cover all sharing of personal information. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age.
Since 2022 and presently, our activities that fall under the definition of “sale or sharing” under California law are: 

using third-party advertising companies that collect information about your visit to our websites and app using cookies and other web technologies to inform our and others’ cross contextual advertising;

sharing customer information with third-party advertising and social media companies to help them better target our advertising on their websites and applications;

sharing customer information with third-parties to help find other potential customers using interest segments they create from your activities across non-affiliated websites and apps.

You can opt out of sale or sharing by accessing our Your Privacy Choices  site. This page also describes how we honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals you may set on your browser. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.    

If you are a Visible member who is logged in to your account when using the GPC signal, we will apply your choice to activity on our website whenever you are logged in and to non-website activities across your account.  However, if you are not logged in or don’t have an account and use a GPC, we will opt you out of sharing activity on our sites, but may need more information from you to identify you and apply your choice to non-website sharing activities.

Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information

You have the right to ask us to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information if we use that information for purposes beyond what is needed to provide the products and services you request or for other reasons specified in the law. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for other purposes without your consent so we do not offer you an option to limit the use of sensitive personal information. The purposes for which we might use sensitive personal information include: detecting security incidents; resisting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal actions; ensuring the physical safety of a person; short-term, transient uses; performing services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, fulfilling orders and transactions; verifying your information; and verifying, maintaining or enhancing a service on a device that is owned manufactured or controlled by us or on your device. We may also share your information with service providers providing storage or similar services on our behalf.

Your Right to Not Be Discriminated Against 

We do not discriminate against you if you exercise any rights described in this section. We will not deny goods or services, charge different prices or rates for goods or services, or provide you a different level or quality of goods and services.

The table below reports the number of verified requests to know received from consumers and other individuals in 2022.

As described above, Visible allows third-party advertising companies to collect information about activity from website visitors and in our apps, for example through cookies and similar technologies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins. These ad entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant Visible advertisements and for other advertising purposes.  During 2022, consumers could learn about this activity and how to opt out on Visible’s “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” webpage. This webpage became Visible’s Your Privacy Choices  webpage in December 2022.  Between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, there were approximately 65,518 unique visitors to the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or “Your Privacy Choices” webpage, however, because the opt out tools available during that time are managed directly by consumers on their devices, we do not have metrics for the number of consumers who opted out.

If you have questions about your rights under California law, email us at privacy@visible.com .

If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be ""portable"", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.

The right to request the deletion of your personal information
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).

If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.

The right to correct inaccurate personal information
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.

The right to opt out of sale or sharing of personal information and to limit the use of your sensitive personal information
You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You also have the right to request that we limit our use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.

The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other rights (the right to non-discrimination)
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.

However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.

To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.

How to exercise your rights
To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.

For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:

provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.

If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.

If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.

You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.

How and when we are expected to handle your request
We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.

We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.

Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.

Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.",,,,,
